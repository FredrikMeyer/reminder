* Reminder

Usage:

#+begin_src bash
npm install && npm link
#+end_src

Then

#+begin_src bash
remind -m 15 -h 1 "Take a break."
#+end_src

Then you will be reminded in one hour and fifteen minutes to take a break.

Use the =-a= option to get an alert that does not disappear. It only works on MacOS:

#+begin_src bash
remind -a -m 10 "Call Santa."
#+end_src
